                "description": "Kanban is extremely effective in helping teams to collaborate better and deliver faster. A physical kanban approach (plain-old sticky notes on a whiteboard) is great for co-located teams, but not everyone has that luxury and even then it has some limitations. Even the most engaged CIO can't regularly visit hundreds of whiteboards. Your offshore team may have trouble moving stickys from 10 1/2 time zones away. And the metrics get kind of tedious to track manually. Most developers we know would rather code than count stickys. LeanKit is designed to be just as simple to use as physical kanban. If you put it up on a touchscreen in your team area, it practically IS physical kanban. But your boards are available from anywhere, including iPhones and iPads, updated in real-time. A slew of colors, icons, and avatars take your visual signalling to the next level. And the system tracks the metrics for you, providing analytics on bottlenecks, cycle time, work distribution, process efficiency, and variability â€“ for a single board or a whole company. It's kanban for the Agile enterprise."
